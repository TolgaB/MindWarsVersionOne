## Game Design
### Objective
The goal of the games is to kill the other player.

### Gameplay Mechanics
The way that the game starts is that either player spawns onto opposite sides of the grid. Both players are then given the choice to move to 1 adjacent block, shoot across any blocks, or melee and do damage to all adjacent blocks. It takes 2 arrows to kill the other player and 1 melee. Both players lock in there move THEN see what their opponent has done.

### Level Design
The level will be a 3 x 3 grid with a cool background (currently being decided by moi).
